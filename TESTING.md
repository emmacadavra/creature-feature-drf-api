## **Testing Overview**

## **Testing Throughout Development**

### **Manual Testing**

### **Automated Tests**

As part of the course content provided by Code Institute, we were introduced to automated testing in Python, and I have demonstrated some of this in the posts app's 'tests.py' file. These tests were to ensure that users could create and update their own posts, but that other users who did not own that post were not able to update or delete them.

I would have liked to experiment more with automated testing in this project, but due to the scale of the project I needed to devote as much time as possible to working on the project itself. In future I plan to take the time to learn more about automated testing so that I can really understand it and appreciate its value to projects such as this one.
