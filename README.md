## **Deployment**

_How to download and set up project locally, and how it can be deployed - remember the following:_
_"If you are cloning my project, then you can skip all pip installs below and just run the following command in the terminal to install all the required libraries/packages at once:
pip install -r requirements.txt
IMPORTANT - If developing locally on your device, ensure you set up/activate the virtual environment (see below) before installing/generating the requirements.txt file; failure to do this will pollute your machine and put other projects at risk"_

* Cmd for setting up venv: python3 -m venv [your_venv_name] (source [your_venv_name]/bin/activate to activate venv)
* Follow instructions on project set up cheatsheet EXCEPT FOR:
    * pip install Pillow==8.2.0 - **USE pip install Pillow==9.3.0 INSTEAD**
    *
